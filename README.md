# 👋 Hi, I'm May

I'm an engineer with a double degree in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🔬 I’m passionate about the intersection of **AI and Neuroscience** — particularly how insights from the brain can inform the next generation of intelligent systems.
- 🤖 During my studies, I worked on:
  - **Gene inference using machine learning**, focusing on biological data analysis.
  - **Reinforcement Learning for autonomous drone flight**, enabling drones to navigate intelligently.
- 📚 I’m always reading about the latest in **neuroscience, cognition, and AI**, and I'm excited about the transformative possibilities these technologies will bring to humanity.

## 🚀 Current Work

I'm currently exploring **graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG)** and the use of **graph databases as memory structures for Large Language Models (LLMs)** — a promising direction for making LLMs more efficient, reliable, and context-aware.

## 🛠️ Tools & Interests

- NLP • Reinforcement Learning • Graph Databases
- Knowledge Graphs • Cognitive Architectures • LLMs
